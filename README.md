Fitness Tracker | Machine Learning-Based Project
This project is a machine learning-based fitness tracker designed to classify barbell exercises and count repetitions using data from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. Developed as a self-initiative during June and July 2024, the project aims to apply advanced data-driven techniques to improve exercise tracking and performance analysis.

Project Overview
The Fitness Tracker uses Python scripts to preprocess, visualize, and model sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope) collected during barbell exercises. By training a machine learning model, the system accurately classifies various exercises and counts repetitions.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Processed accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data for accurate input into the machine learning model.
Visualization: Visualized sensor data to understand exercise patterns.
Machine Learning Model: Built to classify different barbell exercises and accurately count repetitions.
Performance Analysis: Applied advanced data-driven techniques for optimized tracking and performance analysis.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for data processing and machine learning.
Pandas: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For building and training the machine learning model.
Jupyter Notebook: For running experiments and documenting results.

How to Use
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Mridul-Sharma17/Fitness-Tracker.git
Install Required Libraries: Ensure Python and the required dependencies are installed:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Scripts: Load the dataset and execute the scripts to preprocess, visualize data, and train the machine learning model.
Use the Model: After training, the model can classify exercises and count repetitions using new data.

Dataset
The project uses accelerometer and gyroscope data collected during barbell exercises. Sample data is provided in the data/ directory, and it should be preprocessed appropriately before feeding into the model.

Future Enhancements
Real-time exercise tracking through wearable devices.
Exploration of deep learning models for improved accuracy.
Addition of more exercise types for classification.
